Description of Idea

Idea-Developing a platform that would be helping The Business World in setting up the 
bridge between the capable ones and in need 
for their development and profit.


Problem:

As we all are noticing that with passing time, the urge of financial freedom among the people is rising globally. So, those with minimal paycheck are inclining towards Stock Market and people with average paycheck wants to pursue the freedom through Start-up, becoming an enterpreneur, which is a good thing.

The start-ups emerging per year are more than a million, and 90% of them face failure in the early stages. 

Discussion leading to conclusion, about why a start-up fail, below reasons come into light:-

Weak Business Models


Poor Planning


Faulty customer insights or lack of original ideas 


Break in Capital chain


Lacking skills  or Handling single handed


Incompetency in finding and reaching the agreement with the investors

As for now, These reasons are the major issues for Start-up failure as well as for Entrepreneur who are steady and stable.   

The community that is inclining towards Stock Market also suffer from losses as they lack experience and proper knowledge, so they need guidance and mentors to escape from the diring situations while investing.
There are many young and successful investors who are capable for investing in Start-ups but they are not well-known like those who are like celebrity in this field, And the Capital Investment Firms play so safe while dealing with the Start-ups, if it make profit they would be having a huge percentage of profit but if they deal with losses then these firms not only disrupt the capital chain but also file lawsuit against it.
